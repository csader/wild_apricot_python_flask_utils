# Wild Apricot Flask Utilities
Web interface for maker space tool sign-offs implemented in python flask with Wild Apricot oauth and rest on the back end.

The Nova Labs Maker Space evaluated Wild Apricot as a possible solution for member managment. While CiviCRM was ultimately chosen. Methods for implementing a fairly complex tool sign-off system was explored.

Wild Apricot is a commercial member management system for non-profits and clubs. It provides **oAuth** for authentication and a RESTful API.  If you prefer to code your web applications using **Python+Flask** I hope you find this useful to look at
